## Message and Event Patterns
- Load Leveling
- Load Balancing
- Filtering
- Partitioning
- Scheduled Delivery
- Fan Out
- etc.

note:
    <li>Load leveling smooths out intermittent spikes in workload and keeps consumers running smoothly
    <li>Load balancing distributes load among multiple consumers to improve throughput

--

![Message Types](./images/Misc/Message%20Types.png)

note:
    <li> An [event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/compare-messaging-services#event) is a lightweight notification of a condition or a state change.
    <li> A [message](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/compare-messaging-services#message) is raw data produced by a service to be consumed or stored elsewhere. The message contains the data that triggered the message pipeline.

--

## Storage Queues
![Storage Queue](images\Misc\storage-queue1.png)

- Part of Azure Storage
- Large storage capacity
- Message size: 64KB
- No ordering guarantee

note:
    <li> Limited only by the size of the storage account.

--

## Storage Queues
```plantuml
@startuml
left to right direction

skinparam node {
    BackgroundColor White
    BorderColor Blue
}
skinparam queue {
    BackgroundColor White
    BorderColor Blue
}
skinparam arrow {
    Color Blue
}

node "Sender" as nodePub
queue "<size:25>✉✉✉✉✉✉</size>" as queuePubSub
node "Receiver 1" as subscription1
node "Receiver N" as subscriptionN

nodePub --> queuePubSub : Send Message
queuePubSub --> subscription1
queuePubSub --> subscriptionN
subscription1 ~ subscriptionN

## Azure Service Bus Queues
![Service Bus Queue](images\Misc\service-bus-queue.png)
- Push-Pull semantics
- Ordered and timestamped
- Multiple senders and multiple receivers/consumers
- Consumers compete for messages
- Delivery Guarantee: At-lease once or at-most once

note:
    <li>There can be multiple senders and multiple receivers/consumers
    <li>Consumers compete for messages
    <li>Only one consumer can consume a message
    <li>Triple redundant storage
    <li>Service Bus entities exist in a namespace

--

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
## Azure Service Bus Topics
![Service Bus Topics](images\Misc\service-bus-topic.png)
- Push-Pull semantics
- Ordered and timestamped
- Multiple publishers and multiple subscribers
- Multiple subscribers can read the same message

note:
    <li>Subscription filters use SQL syntax
    <li>A SQL <bold>action</bold> is used to manipulate message metadata after a message has been selected by a filter of a subscription rule
    <li>Push-push via SDK

--

## Azure Service Bus Topics

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam rectangle {
    BackgroundColor White
    BorderColor Blue    
}
skinparam node {
    BackgroundColor White
    BorderColor Blue    
}
skinparam queue {
    BackgroundColor White
    BorderColor Blue
}
skinparam arrow {
    Color Blue
}

left to right direction
title <size:30>Topics and Subscriptions

node "Publisher 1" as publisher1
node "Publisher N" as publisherN
queue "<size:30> ✉✉✉✉✉✉" as topic

rectangle "Color = Red" as redFilter
node "Subscriber 1" as subscription1

rectangle "Color = Blue" as blueFilter
node "Subscriber N" as subscriptionN

publisher1 --> topic : "<size:25><color blue>✉ "
publisherN --> topic : "<size:25><color red>✉ "
publisher1 ~ publisherN

topic --> redFilter
redFilter --> subscription1 : "<size 25><color red>✉ "
topic --> blueFilter
blueFilter --> subscriptionN : "<size 25><color blue>✉ "
subscription1 ~ subscriptionN

            <li> User-defined property bag describing the event
            <li> Metadata such as its offset in the partition
            <li> Its number in the stream sequence
            <li> Service-side timestamp at which it was accepted
        </ul>

--

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
## Event Hubs Checkpoint
![Event Hubs Checkpoint](images\Misc\event-hubs-partition-offset.png)

## Event Grid

![Event Grid](images\Misc\functional-model-big.png)

note:
    <li> Event Grid is an eventing backplane that enables event-driven, reactive programming. It uses the publish-subscribe model. Publishers emit events, but have no expectation about how the events are handled. Subscribers decide on which events they want to handle.
    <li> [Event Grid Sources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/overview#event-sources)
    <li> [Event Handlers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/overview#event-handlers)

--

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
## Event Grid

![Event Grid](images\Misc\functional-model-big.png){width="50%"}

- Dynamically scalable
- Low cost
- Serverless
- At least once delivery of an event
- Available on Edge and Kubernetes

note:
    <li> Event Grid is an eventing backplane that enables event-driven, reactive programming. It uses the publish-subscribe model. Publishers emit events, but have no expectation about how the events are handled. Subscribers decide on which events they want to handle.
    <li> [Event Grid Sources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/overview#event-sources)
    <li> [Event Handlers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/overview#event-handlers)
    <li> Simplicity - Point and click to aim events from your Azure resource to any event handler or endpoint.
    <li> Advanced filtering - Filter on event type or event publish path to make sure event handlers only receive relevant events.
    <li> Fan-out - Subscribe several endpoints to the same event to send copies of the event to as many places as needed.
    <li> Reliability - 24-hour retry with exponential backoff to make sure events are delivered.
    <li> Pay-per-event - Pay only for the amount you use Event Grid.
    <li> High throughput - Build high-volume workloads on Event Grid.
    <li> Built-in Events - Get up and running quickly with resource-defined built-in events.
    <li> Custom Events - Use Event Grid to route, filter, and reliably deliver custom events in your app.

--

## Event Grid Terminology
- **Events** - What happened.
- **Event sources** - Where the event took place.
- **Topics** - The endpoint where publishers send events.
- **Event subscriptions** - The endpoint or built-in mechanism to route events.
- **Event handlers** - The app or service reacting to the event.

note:
    <li> Subscription endpoints sometimes route to more than one handler. Subscriptions are also used by handlers to intelligently filter incoming events.

    <li> The extension manages state, checkpoints, and restarts

--

## Function Chaining

![Function Chaining](images/Misc/function-pattern-01-chaining.png)

note:
    <li> A sequence of functions executes in a specific order.
    <li> The output of one function is applied to the input of another function.

--

## Fan Out / Fan In

![Fan Out / Fan In](images/Misc/function-pattern-02-fan-out-fan-in.png)

note:
    <li> A.K.A. Scatter-Gather
    <li> Execute multiple functions in parallel and then wait for all functions to finish.
    <li> Often, some aggregation work is done on the results that are returned from the functions.

--

## Async HTTP APIs

![Async HTTP APIs](images/Misc/function-pattern-03-async-http-api.png)

note:
    <li> Addresses the problem of coordinating the state of long-running operations with external clients.
    <li> A common way to implement this pattern is by having an HTTP endpoint trigger the long-running action. Then, redirect the client to a status endpoint that the client polls

--

## Monitor

![Monitor](images/Misc/function-pattern-04-monitor.png)

note:
    <li> E.g., Poll until some condition is met, then trigger a function
    <li> Timer is a common trigger
    <li> Could be something more somplex than a timer
    <li> Strategies like exponential backoff are common

--

## Human Interaction / Approval

![Human Interaction](images/Misc/function-pattern-05-approval.png)

note:
    <li> Uses [**External Events**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-external-events?tabs=csharp)
    <li> WaitForExternalEvent
    <li> Function defines the event

--

## Aggregator (Stateful Entities)
